# Project Overview

The Gym Management System is built around a microservices architecture, where each service handles a specific domain. This approach allows for better scalability, maintainability, and independent deployment of components. The system currently includes (but is not limited to) services responsible for:

- **Authentication & User Management**: Handling user registration, login, and authorization.
- **Membership Management**: Managing different types of user memberships (e.g., Standard, Platinum).
- **Booking & Room Reservation**: Allowing users to book and reserve various gym rooms/facilities.
