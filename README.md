# üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Gym Management System

The Gym Management System is built around a **microservices architecture**, where each service handles a specific domain. This modular approach enables better scalability, maintainability, and independent deployment. The system currently includes (but is not limited to) services responsible for:

- **Authentication & User Management** ‚Äì user registration, login, JWT-based authorization.
- **Membership Management** ‚Äì handling membership plans and subscriptions.
- **Booking & Room Reservation** ‚Äì allowing users to book gym rooms and other facilities.
